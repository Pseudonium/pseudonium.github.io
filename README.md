Welcome! I just finished a masters degree in Mathematics, and will be starting a PhD in Condensed Matter Physics this October. I love it because it feels like I’m going to get to learn how to do magic in real life!

I’m a physicist. But I also like lots of math, from calculus to category theory. And I’m especially interested in ways to improve math education. Feel free to ask me about any of those!

Outside that, I love playing video games, watching anime, playing frisbee, playing piano and singing.
